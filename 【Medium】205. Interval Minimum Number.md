**Example:** 

For array [1,2,7,8,5], and queries [(1,2),(0,4),(2,4)], return [2,1,5]

## 解题思路

Segment Tree。

建树操作：

 + [201. Segment Tree Build](https://github.com/ForestCold/Algorithms/edit/master/%E3%80%90Medium%E3%80%91201.%20Segment%20Tree%20Build.md)

查询操作：

 + [247. Segment Tree Query II](https://github.com/ForestCold/Algorithms/blob/master/%E3%80%90Medium%E3%80%91247.%20Segment%20Tree%20Query%20II.md)
