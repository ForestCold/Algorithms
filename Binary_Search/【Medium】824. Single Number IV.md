> Give an array, all the numbers appear twice except one number which appears once and all the numbers which appear twice are next to each other. Find the number which appears once.

> **Notice:** 
1 <= nums.length < 10^4
In order to limit the time complexity of the program, your program will run 10^5 times.

## 解题思路

a. HashMap 

b. Sort + Two pointers

## 时间空间复杂度
a. O(m+n) + S(m) 

b. O(nlogn) + S(1)

m为较短的array长度，n为较长的array长度
